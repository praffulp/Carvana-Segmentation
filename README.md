Semantic segmentation for Carvana Dataset from kaggle challenge(https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/overview) with U-NET implementation from scratch.

This project was done for understanding how to implement an architecture from scratch. I came across a popular Kaggle challenge Carvana Image Masking Challenge and tested my implementation for this dataset.
